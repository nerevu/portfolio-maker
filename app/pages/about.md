## Me

### My Life

I graduated from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) in 2005 with a degree in chemical engineering. During my time there I worked summer research internships at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://www.lanl.gov) and [Proctor & Gamble](http://www.pg.com) and soon realized R&D wasn't my cup of tea. Not long afterwards I found out about the [MIT E-Club](http://web.mit.edu/e-club/) and fell in love with entrepreneurship. Shortly afterwards I co-founded [Entreprelliance](http://www.entreprelliance.com), an intercollegiate entrepreneurship organization, and [CarboTran Technologies](https://www.google.com/search?q=carbotran+technologies), a failed clean-energy startup.

After graduating, I went on to found [Pensero Group](https://www.google.com/search?q=pensero+group), a financial reporting and analysis consulting company, and worked as a business consultant at [MIDIOR Consulting](http://www.midior.com/) helping clients develop new-product strategies.

Having lived in [Cambridge, MA]() for ten years, I left in 2010 to work for [Global Cycle Solutions](http://www.gcstz.com/) (GCS) in [Arusha, Tanzania](http://goo.gl/maps/eula2). At GCS I worked on various projects including accounting and financial modeling; sales, marketing, and strategy; [CRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRM), reporting system, and inventory management system development; training design and facilitation; and recruitment.


I left GCS in late 2012 and currently live in Arusha, Tanzania developing [web and command line applications](/projects).

### My Interests

#### _Technology_

Over the years I've picked up quite a few computer skills. My introduction to programming was with BASIC on a [V-Tech Pre Computer Powerpad](https://www.google.com/search?q=vtech+pre+computer+powerpad) around the age of 12. Since then I've learned PHP, Visual Basic, C, MATLAB/R, SQL, HTML/CSS, and Python respectively. My initial applications were primarily command line based but I learned enough about [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org) to make a website for Pensero Group. Currently, I'm developing web based applications in Python with Flask.

#### _Finance/Investing_

I started investing at the end of 1999 at the age of 17. Unknown to me at the time, I couldn't have picked a worse period to begin... this was the beginning of the [market collapse of 2000](). I've learned a lot since then and am convinced about the principles of dollar cost averaging, passive index investing, and asset allocation. I'm also enamored with hedge funds and in the process of developing an application to unlock the secrets of [replicating their returns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund_replication).

#### _Travel_

I love to travel and have so far been to around 20 countries including 13 in Africa.

#### _Other_

* Reproducible research
* Global health
* Healthcare IT (think EMR)
* Personalized medicine
* Biotech/Pharma
* Diagnostics
* Salsa dancing
