## Me

My name is Reuben Cummings and I am Data Scientist and Web Application Developer.
I specialize in financial/data analysis and offline capable web applications.
I handle database development, API integration, responsive web design, and
automated reporting solutions.

## My Life

I graduated from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) in
2005 with a degree in chemical engineering. During my time there I worked summer
research internships at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://www.lanl.gov)
and [Proctor & Gamble](http://www.pg.com) and soon realized R&D wasn't my cup of
tea. Not long afterwards I found out about the
[MIT E-Club](http://web.mit.edu/e-club/) and fell in love with entrepreneurship.
Shortly afterwards I co-founded
[Entreprelliance](http://www.entreprelliance.com), an intercollegiate
entrepreneurship organization, and
[CarboTran Technologies](https://www.google.com/search?q=carbotran+technologies),
a failed clean-energy startup.

After graduating, I went on to found
[Pensero Group](https://www.google.com/search?q=pensero+group), a financial
reporting and analysis consulting company, and worked as a business consultant
at [MIDIOR Consulting](http://www.midior.com/) helping clients develop
new-product strategies.

Having lived in [Cambridge, MA]() for ten years, I left in 2010 to work for
[Global Cycle Solutions](http://www.gcstz.com/) (GCS) in
[Arusha, Tanzania](http://goo.gl/maps/eula2). At GCS I worked on various
projects including accounting and financial modeling; sales, marketing, and
strategy; [CRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRM), reporting system, and
inventory management system development; training design and facilitation; and
recruitment.


I left GCS in late 2012 and currently live in Arusha, Tanzania developing
[web and command line applications](/projects).

## My Interests

### _Technology_

I first learned to code in BASIC at the age of 13 on a [VTECH Pre-Computer POWER PAD](https://www.google.com/search?q=vtech+pre+computer+powerpad). In high school I wrote games for my TI-81 calculator; and by college I had mastered Excel Pivot Tables and dabbled with with Linux shell scripting. Upon graduating from MIT in 2005, I made my first website in PHP and began creating Excel applications in VBA.

Shortly thereafter, I was developing database (MS Access and SQLite), automated reporting, and business intelligence applications. And during that time I expanded my PHP and BASH scripting abilities.

In 2010 I found Python and fell in love with its simplicity and elegance. I soon replaced PHP with it as my language of choice for new script or web development projects. Since then, I have used Python extensively for automating basic tasks, data analysis, creating API backends, and rapid web prototyping.

More recently I have been using a combination of coffeescript/javascript (Nodejs, Backbone, jquery, etc.) and python (Flask) to create offline-capable database (PostgreSQL and MongoDB) or API driven web applications that dynamically respond to any device size (mobile, tablet, laptop, or desktop).

### _Finance/Investing_

I started investing at the end of 1999 at the age of 17. Unknown to me at the
time, I couldn't have picked a worse period to begin... this was the beginning
of the [market collapse of 2000](). I've learned a lot since then and am
convinced about the principles of dollar cost averaging, passive index
investing, and asset allocation. I'm also enamored with hedge funds and in the
process of developing an application to unlock the secrets of [replicating their
returns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund_replication).

### _Travel_

I love to travel and have so far been to around 20 countries including 13 in
Africa.

### _Other_

* Reproducible research
* Global health
* Healthcare IT (EMR)
* Personalized medicine
* Salsa dancing
