I've decided to do it.... take the vacation I never had a chance to take during my undergrad years. What started out as a desire to visit an island in the caribbean has now turned into a half-baked plan to take a month off of work hopping to as many caribbean islands as I can with free (or as close to it as I can get) accomodations. <!-- more --> I just recently started doing research on this and found out that some airlines offer caribbean air passes for $500 - $600 for travel between many of the caribbean islands.

The current itinerary includes the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. I should be able to squeeze in 1 or 2 more islands and am thinking about adding Jamaica and Trinidad. Being my first time to the caribbean, I figured I might as well try out blogging for a change too since as the saying goes "there's a first time for everything." I'll keep this blog updated as my plans develop and will write about the excursions as I navigate the sun baked beaches during my trip.

So if anyone has suggestions on what I should do while i'm on each island, other places I should visit, a spare couch or floor to offer during my travels, or just any tips or advice in general.... please let me know.
