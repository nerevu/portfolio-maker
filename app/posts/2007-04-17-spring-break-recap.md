Last month I made good on my promise to visit Carlos in the Dominican Republic. Although I wasn't able to turn my spring break into an island hopping tour around the Caribbean, I still had more fun traveling around the DR than I could have ever imagined. "So what happend to your plans on taking a month off to travel", I hear you ask. Well, the whole [caribbean air pass](http://www.airtimetable.com/airpass.htm) I read about is apparently a lot harder to find than I thought. <!-- more --> Many of the airlines discontinued their pass (e.g., [LIAT](http://www.liatairline.com/) and [Caribbean Airlines](http://www.caribbean-airlines.com)) and the ones that had them available didn't fly to the DR (like [Windward Islands Airways](http://www.fly-winair.com/)). But that didn't stop me from taking a month off of work though :) (well 3 weeks, but who's counting). I spent the first week and a half catching up on work for my startup, Pensero Group, and the next 11 days in the beautiful Dominican Republic sun. (when I get around to it, i'll put up some pics and videos... don't hold your breath though). And the one must do for any would be DR tourist is to visit [Bahia de las Aguilas](http://flickr.com/search/?q=bahia+de+las+aguilas+). We camped out overnight on this deserted beach which was home to the bluest water i've ever seen.
